            <p></p>I’m Isabel 玥 Li (they, she), a non-binary Chinese-Kiwi artist, writer, researcher, and pattern-matcher. I studied Computer Science, Creative Writing, and Design at UC Berkeley. I conduct human-computer interaction research at the Berkeley Institute of Design, investigating creativity support tools for artists and youths’ technological futures. As a software engineer at Netflix, I build tools for translation and accessibility. 
            
            <p></p>My work is always traversing love, physical distance, language/culture, social media, queerness, self, and remixes of these things--physical media, love languages, queer culture, social distance, and so on.
            
            <p></p>I often cross the Pacific Ocean between San Francisco, California, and Auckland, New Zealand. You can find me wide-eyed at the gachapon in Japantown, documenting each dog at Alamo Square with a Kuretake, or hovering behind the fiction at Unity Books. You can find some of my work in Kernel, Re-Draft, and scattered ‘round the net.
            
            <p></p>Some things that make my heart beat faster include queer interpretations of pre-19th century literature, cartoons with awful bad-boy characters, peculiar ice cream flavours, clothing with ribbons and pearled buttons, sitting by the sea, and coming across cognates organically.
            
            <p></p>Please reach out if you would like to create a more joyful world with me / collaborate together / add me on Neopets. 
            
            <p></p>下次见！
